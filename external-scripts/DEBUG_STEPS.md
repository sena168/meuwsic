# Meuwsic Debug Steps Log

## Quick Debug Reference - Numbered Steps

### 1. Fixed Previous Button Inconsistent Behavior
**Issue**: Previous button wrapped from first song to last regardless of repeat mode  
**Method**: Updated `handlePrevious()` logic in `MusicPlayer.tsx` to match `handleNext()` conditional checks

### 2. Fixed Next Button Not Working at Last Song
**Issue**: Next button stopped working when at last song with repeat off  
**Method**: Modified boundary logic in `handleNext()` in `MusicPlayer.tsx` to allow navigation but stop auto-play

### 3. Fixed Previous Button Not Working at First Song  
**Issue**: Previous button stopped working when at first song with repeat off  
**Method**: Updated `handlePrevious()` boundary conditions in `MusicPlayer.tsx`

### 4. Fixed Time Search Bar Not Working
**Issue**: Progress bar clicks weren't seeking audio position  
**Method**: Enhanced `handleProgressClick()` in `MusicPlayer.tsx` with better duration detection and percentage calculations

### 5. Fixed Duration Not Loading Reliably
**Issue**: Audio duration wasn't being set consistently  
**Method**: Added `durationchange` and `canplay` event listeners in `useEffect` in `MusicPlayer.tsx`

### 6. Fixed Duration Validation
**Issue**: Invalid duration values causing seek errors  
**Method**: Added validation checks in `updateDuration()` function in `MusicPlayer.tsx`

### 7. Fixed Last Song Auto-Navigation
**Issue**: When repeat off, last song finished would jump to first song  
**Method**: Modified `handleEnded()` in `MusicPlayer.tsx` to stay on last song when repeat is 'none'

### 8. Fixed Manual Navigation Playing State
**Issue**: Manual next/previous stopped playing at boundaries when repeat off  
**Method**: Simplified navigation logic in both `handleNext()` and `handlePrevious()` to always maintain playing state if was playing

### 9. Fixed Shuffle Mode Auto-Play Behavior
**Issue**: When shuffle is enabled, songs would stop playing after finishing naturally if repeat mode was 'none'  
**Method**: Modified `handleEnded()` function to prioritize shuffle mode over repeat mode - when shuffle is on, it always continues to next random song regardless of repeat setting
