3. **Progress Control**: Interactive progress bar with click-to-seek
4. **Volume Control**: Volume slider with mute toggle
5. **Shuffle Mode**: Random track selection
6. **Repeat Modes**: None, All, One
7. **Real-time Updates**: Current time, duration, progress display

## 🐛 Issues Debugged & Fixed

### 1. Navigation Button Boundary Issues
**Problem**: Previous/Next buttons had inconsistent behavior at playlist boundaries
**Root Cause**: Complex conditional logic that stopped navigation at boundaries when repeat was off
**Solution**: 
- Updated `handleNext()` and `handlePrevious()` functions
- Simplified logic to always allow navigation
- Differentiated between manual navigation (buttons) and automatic playback (song end)

### 2. Progress Bar Click Functionality
**Problem**: Time search bar (progress bar) clicks weren't working for audio seeking
**Root Cause**: 
- Duration not being set reliably
- Insufficient audio event listeners
- Poor error handling for invalid duration values
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `handleProgressClick()` with better duration detection
- Added multiple audio event listeners: `durationchange`, `canplay`, `loadedmetadata`
- Improved duration validation and error handling
- Used percentage-based calculations for accurate seeking

### 3. Last Song Behavior with Repeat Off
**Problem**: When repeat was off and last song finished, it would jump to first song and stop
**Expected**: Should stay on the last song when it finishes
**Solution**: Modified `handleEnded()` function to check if current track is the last song and stay put instead of navigating

### 4. Manual Navigation Playing State
**Problem**: When manually pressing next/previous, playing state would stop at boundaries (last→first, first→last) when repeat was off
**Expected**: Manual navigation should always maintain playing state if music was already playing
**Solution**: Simplified navigation logic to always continue playing if `wasPlaying` was true, regardless of boundaries

## 🎯 Current State & Behavior

### Navigation Behavior:
- **Manual Navigation** (Button Presses):
  - Playing → Next/Previous: ✅ Keeps playing
  - Paused → Next/Previous: ✅ Stays paused  
  - Works at all boundaries: ✅ Last→First, First→Last

### Automatic Playback Behavior:
- **Repeat Off + Last Song**: ✅ Stays on last song, stops playing
- **Repeat All**: ✅ Continues to next song seamlessly
- **Repeat One**: ✅ Repeats current song infinitely

### Interactive Controls:
- **Progress Bar**: ✅ Click anywhere to seek to that position
- **Volume Control**: ✅ Slider with mute toggle
- **Shuffle**: ✅ Random track selection with proper logic
- **All Buttons**: ✅ Responsive and functional

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Key Functions in MusicPlayer.tsx:
- `handlePlay()`: Play/pause toggle with error handling
- `handleNext()`: Navigate to next track with repeat/shuffle logic
- `handlePrevious()`: Navigate to previous track with repeat/shuffle logic  
- `handleProgressClick()`: Seek to clicked position on progress bar
- `handleEnded()`: Handle song completion based on repeat mode
- `handleVolumeChange()`: Volume control
- `toggleShuffle()`, `toggleRepeat()`, `toggleMute()`: Mode toggles

### Audio Event Listeners:
- `timeupdate`: Update current playback time
- `loadedmetadata`: Set duration when metadata loads
- `durationchange`: Handle duration changes
- `canplay`: Additional duration setting opportunity
- `ended`: Handle song completion
- `play`/`pause`: Update playing state
- `loadstart`: Reset playing state on new track load

### State Management:
- `currentTrack`: Currently selected track object
- `isPlaying`: Boolean for play/pause state
- `currentTime`: Current playback position in seconds
- `duration`: Total track duration in seconds
- `volume`: Volume level (0-1)
- `isMuted`: Mute state boolean
- `isShuffled`: Shuffle mode boolean
- `repeatMode`: 'none' | 'all' | 'one'
